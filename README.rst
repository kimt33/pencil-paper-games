Single Piece Boardgame Simulator
================================
This module provides a general framework for building a turn-based boardgame wherein each player
places a single type of piece onto the grid.

It was first intended to be just a tic tac toe game (and still is for the most part). I just added a
general structure because the generalization looked interesting. Think connect4, dots and boxes,
omok, go, and even battleship - though go should probably be implemented differently. We can scale
up the size of the board and even introduce more players.

Just tic tac toe for now. And probably forever.
